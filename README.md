### This theme was inspired by my love of dark coding themes, Sarah Drasner's Night Owl theme, Wes Bos' Cobalt2 theme and Scott Tolinski's LevelUp Official Theme.

### The name of this comes from ONA Cafe in Marrickville in Sydney, Australia. My favorite roast they have is called Raspberry Candy and I have had way too many of those while at that cafe. 

*__Big thanks to [LambdaScientist](https://github.com/LambdaScientist) for the PR about making some updates to the colors in raspberryCandy.__*
